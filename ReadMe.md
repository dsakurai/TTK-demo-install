This is a semi-automatic script that installs a demo enviroment of [TTK](https://topology-tool-kit.github.io/installation.html).

This is a work in progress. The scripts are unworkable at the moment.

Before you do anything
----------------------

Never save anything within this demo directory nor directories generated by the scripts in this project.
Do not develop code within this demo directory nor directories generated by the scripts in this project.
This script may REMOVE your changes.
Yep, you have been warned.

For other usual warnings, read the license file that ships with this project.
I am happy to change the license to something more suitable.

How To
------

On Unix, run this bash command. It might work as well on zsh.
~~~
$ source <(curl -Ls https://github.com/dsakurai/TTK-demo-install/raw/master/one_line_install.sh)
~~~
Just continue hitting enter, and you'll get a TTK demo environment.

A oneliner script that skips manual git-clone is in the plan.
